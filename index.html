                Yeah, that's me...
                <p>
                    I learn from people 2 steps ahead of me and teach people 2 steps behind me.
                    That's a recipe for success if you ask me.
                    Being genuine is a rarity these days, but I'm trying my best to be just that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the beginning I knew I won't achieve what I want by myself. 
                    This has been a big part of what I do - to guide others as we change the world. 
                    It all started small, but always with the big picture in mind... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, that it all has grown so much, I am able to inspire and help people who follow my journey on social media and people that are in what I call <a href="#">The Realm</a> 
                    while working alongside some of them in my <a href="#">business</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to be a part of our journey and you like what I am doing, let me...
